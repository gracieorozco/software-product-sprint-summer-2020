                <h4>Software Engineering Class Project (Feb. 2020 - May 2020)</h4>
                <p>An inventory management system for CPSC 362. The Flask framework is used to manage the page navigation and data handling with Python. HTML is used to create the base content while Bootstrap makes the interface visually appealing.</p>

                <h4>National Park Service Information Kiosk (June 2019)</h4>
                <p>
                    This project is a web application that was submitted to Capital
                    One's MindSumo Challenge. This web applicationâ€™s purpose is to
                    help users find information involving the national parks in the
                    United States by using the National Park Service API. The project
                    utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a visual
                    interface to search information through the National Park Service
                    API. The website is responsive to any device and adjusts its
                    layout accordingly, allowing mobile devices to access this
                    website as well.

                <h4>Summer 2019 Research (May 2019 - May 2020)</h4>
                <p>
                    With the CSU Fullerton's organization, ASSURE-US, I researched
                    concepts involving data science using Python and Jupyter notebook
                    by completing a small-scale data science project on a topic of
                    preference to understand the mathematics behind data science.
                    My research discovered which factor within college admissions is
                    the best indicator in predicting salary earnings.

                <p>
                    Hackathon project that allows users to help people search for
                    drivers from a start destination to an end destination. I
                    focused on front-end work using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript to create the website.

                <h4>Agenda</h4>
                <p>
                    This project is an online agenda that uses the
                    local storage of a browser to store to-do list
                    items for a templsted week in a minimalistic way.
                    I plan to expand this to reflect the month and
                    years while incorpoating some other productive
                    habits.

                <h4>HTML/CSS Tutorial Website</h4>
                <p>
                    This website is a quick quide to explain the
                    basics of HTML and CSS. I provide information
                    on the structure and a description of common
                    tags. I plan to expand this idea later on by
                    adding JavaScript and other technologies and
                    frameworks such as Bootstrap and more. I would
                    hope that this website would be used in future
                    projects to quickly understand the core concepts
                    to ease time constraints.

                <h4>Computer Science Fundamentals Website</h4>
                <p>
                    I plan to make a website based on the knowledge
                    I learned throughout my college years. This will
                    incorporate the basic and core classes of computer
                    science such as object-oriented programming, data
                    structures, operating systems, and more. My main goal
                    for this program is to help future students understand
                    the expectations of the major and give them a headstart
                    in their learning.
